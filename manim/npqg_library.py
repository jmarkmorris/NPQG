# This is a library of reusable NPQG software.
# 
# The intent is to have an object oriented hierarchy.
# First pass ideas...
# point_charge : Fundamental
# binary : inherits  point_charge
# dual_binary : inherits binary
# tri_binary : inherits dual_binary (i.e., those characteristics and more, right?) 
# Noether_core : inherits tri_binary, adds pro and anti geometries
# personality_charge : inherits point_charge
# personality_duo : inherits personality_charge (using the right hand rule we can be specific on the geometry)
# personality : inherits personality_duo, color - where color corresponds to generation or number of binaries in the nest.
# I wonder if anyone has ever thought of mapping color charge to generations of quarks?  Hmmm, that's an interesting new mapping.
# fermion : inherits
