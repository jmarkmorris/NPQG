# The goal is to illustrate each of Maxwell's Equations in the point charge universe.
# Show how they apply and the implications.
# Show revisions if needed.
# this is the language of maxwell's equations, so need to understand them again and relate them to point charges.
# then I should be ready to simulate!
# also may need to clarify those equations!!!  especially at r=0, and v>@.
# I should do a verision in natural units, where @=1, q=1, etc.  Then do the translation.
# that J in maxwell's fourth equation sticks out like a sore thumb. that's not describing point charges.
# they need to be rewritten for point charges.

# Divergence.
# the unit potentials are the only entities with divergence. 
# translated into our terminology, 
# the electrino has a charge divergence of -e/6, 
# the positrino has a charge divergence of +e/6,
# that's it, there is no other divergence in the universe. This is it.
# so that is another characteristic of the unit potentials.
# Show the divergence relative to the eight-ball (t, x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, q)
# and the charge divergence for each point charge is q / (1+v)  
# If we take the unit sphere then f(x,y,z) = x*xhat, y*yhat, z*zhat.
# So the natural divergence is 3 according to Brunton because each partial derivative yields 1 and they are summed by the dot product.
# But what are we trying to measure here?  Charge or potential? Or both.
# If we define the potential field as f(x,y,z,t)= q/@r, where r = sqrt (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
# so what is the divergence of this potential field? Now it is more complicated.
# what are the units of divergence anyway?  Is it a charge or potential per unit area? i.e., over a sphere?
# if math defines divergence as dimensionless, should I put in the units for this specific application of math?
# It would make sense to at least have a trace of how all the dimensional analysis arises.
