NEOCLASSICAL PHYSICS AND QUANTUM GRAVITY

Imagine that nature emerges from two flavors of immutable point charges, the electrino and the positrino, which are equal yet oppositely charged. These are the only carriers of energy, in electromagnetic and kinetic form. The are located in an infinite three-dimensional Euclidean space (i.e., flat, non-curvy) and observe classical mechanics and Maxwell’s equations. Point charge characteristics include immutability, meaning they cannot be created nor destroyed and any two point charges have a finite closes possible approach. Point charges emit spherical electromagnetic waves from their center yet immutability allows us to think of point charges as physical tiny spheres with a radius at the scale of the Planck length.

NPQG explores this recipe for nature and how it emerges as a narrative and theory that is compatible with GR, QM, modified ΛCDM, yet superior in ability to explain the universe and resolve open problems.
