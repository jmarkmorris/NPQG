# This is a list of ideas for animation

# Illustrate the field of a point charge
#     Transform from circle to larger circle with lighter shade.
#     Opacity reduced by calculating 1/r^2
# for percent in range (1:32:1):
#   self.add(Circle(radius=percent * Percent(X_AXIS)))
#   decrease the opacity of the line by 3 * percent each circle
#   fade out the prior circle (or maybe lag a bit? see how it looks)

# Illustrate field objects x,y,z,t or r, theta, phi

# Illustrate electrino field objects as blue
# Illustrate positrino field objects as red 
# Illustrate superposition with purple and black where cancelled 

# Illustrate the closest approach electrino-electrino or positrino-positrino at 0 Hz, suddenly released and dynamically show how PR reduces and KE increases. 
# Show the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian.

# Ways to show the field strength on planes or other geometrical structures around an orbiting dipole, such as a cylinder, the axes of rotation, the sphere, etc.  

# Watch 3B1B videos for animations that generate ideas about how to illustrate the point charge universe

# I created a new channel as a brand account. The channel name can change later when I get a custom URL.
# Requirement : the name of the channel must match the link text.
# Consideration : that since the link text is sans white space, that the channel name also be sans white space. 
# Preference : the name of the channel be relevant to the content. 
# N.B. new account must be 30 days ond with 100 or more subscribers to get a custom url.

# Make 3D visualizations for all the particles
# A whole video series on the photon, how it counter-rotates and self propels, and how polarization and Malus Law work.
# The point charge standard model chart, with each particle doing its thing in 3D animation

# Sal says changes to the small body mass don't change the orbital velocity around big M earth.

# That means radius doesn't change either 
# So for that system only velocity determined radius of orbit.  Check the math.
# What is the situation for gravitational orbit of two equal bodies?  Only velocity matters? 
# More importantly what is really going on here? 
# It's just two blobs of point charges in point charge structures sailing through the point charge aether after all. 


# I could make a whole 'nother series of videos to talk about the equivalence principle from a point charge structure perspective,
# With work done by a force causing acceleration which both changes the orbital radii and tilts the orbital planes of the tri-dipole.
# Acceleration tilts the planes.
    # and momentum keeps the planes at those relative angles.
    # which raises the question of defining momentum of a point charge. 
    # All of the energy of an isolated point charge is apparent. 
        # Does that mean an isolated point charge has mass?
        # No, I think mass is caused by the interaction of apparent energy with the spacetime aether.
    # Hmm. Need to really think out what is happening here.
    # It doesn't appear to matter if the direction of the velocity changes as long as the magnitude stays the same.
    # And this is the situation for linear momentum with constant velocity vs. angular momentum and changing velocity direction.
    # If you turn this logic around, it's almost as if the particle is self propelling itself through the aether.
